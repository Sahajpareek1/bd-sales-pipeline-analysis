# BD Sales Pipeline Analysis & Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on **cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing** a Business Development (BD) sales pipeline dataset.  
The dataset contains **900+ opportunities** spanning multiple stages of the sales process, with details such as client information, lead source, deal size, and revenue.

The final output is an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that provides insights into the sales pipeline performance, win rates, deal values, and conversion trends.

  - `BD_Representative` â†’ Filled with `"Unknown"`
  - `Lead_Source` â†’ Filled with `"Unknown"`
  - `Lead_Score` â†’ Filled with median
  - `Expected_Deal_Size` â†’ Filled with median
  - `Industry` & `Campaign` â†’ Pending decision â†’ `"Unknown"`
  - `Deal_Closed_Date` â†’ Left as missing (mostly ongoing deals)
- **Corrected data types:**
  - Converted date columns to `datetime`
  - Converted numeric columns to appropriate types
- **Standardized formatting:**
  - Fixed inconsistent capitalization and spelling in `Region`, `Client_Name`, and `BD_Representative`
- **Removed duplicates**
